# Basic HTTP Server (C and C++ Versions)
## Overview
This repository contains two implementations of a simple HTTP server -- one written in C and the other in 
C++. Both servers listen for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port and respond with basic HTTP responses,
such as returning an HTML page or echoing back parts of the request.
